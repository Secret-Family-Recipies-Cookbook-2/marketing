					<h2>What is our secret?</h2><br>
					<p>
						We make it convenient for everyone to keep track of all their recipes. No more digging through books, boxes, attics, or various folders on your computer
						to find where you misplaced a recipe for date night, movie night, or Monday Night. You'll be able to sort through your collection to easily get the desired
						recipe faster than you can microwave leftover pizza. But why stop there? Invite your friends and family, and share your recipes with them while giving them
						meaningless honorary titles like 'Sous Chef' to encourage them to cook the meals for you.
